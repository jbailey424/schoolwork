    	<h2> Look at these Figures! <br> Made for the DATA 303 "Interacting with Data" Assignment</h2>
        <iframe src="categories.html" title="Parallel categories plot" width = "1200" height = "620" 
        frameBorder="0" style="margin-top: 60px;">
            <h3>Parallel categories plot</h3>
        </iframe> 
        <p style="margin: 0 110px;">The first figure, the parallel categories plot, visualizes the distribution of survey responses along three categorical questions: income bracket, education, and voting habit. Lines on the figure show how respondents with one particular response are distributed along other possible responses. For example, the bands between the highest income group and the college group are generally wider, showing that most high-income respondents are college educated. Similarly, bands betweeen the college group and rarely voting group are generally thinner, indicating that college-educated respondents are less likely to rarely or never vote. Analyzing these trends across the entire figure, it is evident that more high-income or college-educated respondents always vote, and more low-income or less-educated respondents rarely or never vote.</p>
        <iframe src="bubble.html" title="Bubble plot" width = "1200" height = "620" 
        frameBorder="0" style="margin-top: 120px;">
            <h3>Bubble plot</h3>
        </iframe> 
        <p style="margin: 0 110px;">This animated bubble plot displays the total voter turnout and percentage of absentee ballots for each locality in Virginia, with an animation slider to show five different elections between 2014 and 2022. While some data is missing or out of the proper scale, the broad trends remain evident. Primarily, in 2020 and 2016 there were presidential elections, which visibly drove up the overall turnout. Also, in 2020 during the pandemic there was a sharp rise in absentee voting as people were hesitant to go to in-person polling locations.</p>
        <iframe src="map.html" title="Heatmap plot" width = "1200" height = "600" 
        frameBorder="0" style="margin-top: 120px;">
            <h3>Heatmap plot</h3>
        </iframe> 
        <p style="margin: 0 110px;">Our final figure is a heatmap of Virginia, showing 2022 voter turnout in each locality. This is using the same data as the 2022 frame of the previous bubble plot, but shows geographic trends of voter turnout instead of mapping turnout with absentee percentage. On this map, there are a few trends to be seen. Areas in central and northern virginia seem to have higher turnout, and localities in the southwest have noticeable lower turnout. While the same information can be seen on the bubble plot, displaying it on a geographic map makes the trends between counties much more visible. <br><br><br><br> Thank you for reading!
